'''
(a) Suppose the input graph G = (V, E) is stored in an array of adjacency lists and 
    we  use  a  minimizing  heap  for  the  priority  queue.  

    Implement  the  Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm using this setting and analyze its time complexity 
    with respect to |V| and |E| both theoretically and empirically.
